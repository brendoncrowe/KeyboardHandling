# Keyboard Handling
For many iOS applications, keyboard handling is very important. For a seamless user experience, the keyboard should not be covering important views
such as buttons, labels, text fields, etc.

To fix this issue if it arrises, a good implementation is to capture the keyboard appearing and disappearing via the NotificationCenter.
